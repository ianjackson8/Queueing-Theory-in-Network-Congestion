# Queuing Theory in Network Congestion Control

## Project Overview
This project explores TCP congestion control using queuing theory principles. 
The goal is to model network congestion using M/M/1 or M/M/c queueing models and analyze the effects of different TCP congestion control algorithms such as TCP Reno and CUBIC.

## Objectives
- Apply queuing theory to model TCP flow through network routers.
- Implement and simulate congestion control using Python.
- Compare the performance of different TCP congestion control algorithms.
- Analyze key performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and packet loss.

## Implementation
The project includes model formulation, simulation, and performance evaluation.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Queuing Models:** M/M/1, M/M/c
- **Congestion Control Protocols:** TCP Reno, TCP CUBIC
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Expected Outcomes
- A comparative analysis of TCP congestion control algorithms.
- Insights into how queuing theory models network performance.
- A research report and an oral presentation detailing findings.
